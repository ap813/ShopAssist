In ShoppingAssistant, the app will start by prompting the user for the budget of the trip. This can be a rough estimate or an accurate to the cent amount that the user wants to spend.

The intended use of the app is for grocery shopping or shopping at larger store like Target, Walmart, etc.

After receiving the amount of the trip, users will be able to add costs and a short descriptor to keep track of the items in the "cart". This will help in the organization and identification of items that might be put back.

Once added to the cart, there will be a price displayed to the user to show how much the check out price will be. Users will define the most common tax that they will pay at these store in their profile. This app has no backend so all the info will be held in AsyncStorage.

Users will be able to change tax on their profile.

Profiles will include:
- Name
- Tax info
- Number of Uses
- Percentage info of staying on budget eg. (80% on budget)

UI will be simple and will be user friendly.
The app is mostly for myself as well so if it does well that's cool too.
